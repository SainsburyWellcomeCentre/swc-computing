## HPC Task Description
<!-- Provide a detailed, specific example of what you need to accomplish. The more specific, the better! For example: -->
<!-- "I need to know how to..." -->
<!-- - request 4 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory each for a single PyTorch distributed training job. -->
<!-- - set up a Conda environment with CUDA 11.7 and PyTorch 2.0 that persists across jobs. -->
<!-- - decide which filesystem to use to store my training logs. -->
<!-- - transfer a 500GB dataset from my local machine to the cluster's /scratch directory using rsync. -->
<!-- - debug why my job with 64GB memory request is stuck in the queue for over 24 hours. -->
<!-- - use Slurm's array jobs to run a hyperparameter sweep with 100 different configurations of my JAX model. -->

## Required Resources
<!-- List the SWC/Gatsby HPC resources this task needs. For example: -->
<!-- - Compute nodes (type and number): -->
<!-- - GPUs (type, number, and memory): -->
<!-- - Storage system and space needed: -->
<!-- - Required software or modules: -->
